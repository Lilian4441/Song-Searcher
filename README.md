# Song-Searcher
<h3>A user friendly song searcher app.</h3>
<h4>Completed: October 2023</h4>

This project involved developing a user-friendly frontend for the app, enabling interactive song searches as well as data file loading based on danceabiity scores. It also involved implementing command loop functionality with user feedback to avoid invalid input.</br>
</br>Note: the included files are of the frontend only, and do not function fully. This was a partner project, and my partner was responsible for the backend.
